# bootstrap-four
Working with bootstrap four. Continued Self-Taught. Udemy online- Colt Steele.

## Description:
Working with the new library of bootstrap four. Gain the understanding and use (basics) of the bootstrap four library.
Understanding some key differences. Using the new technoques for quick page layout. 
During this build, we will only be building quick web pages to gain the knowledge and the understanding of the bootstrap four library. These sites will not be the best for presentation, serving more of the purpose of demostration. Create a breakdown section to follow along with what we are learning along the way. More than just coding along, understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. Make the note to recall the learning session if needed.

## Breakdown: 

1. Lets begin with creating the README file and filling in all the main content for our purpose behind this project. Next.
2. Create our save points and commit these new changes to the file.
3. Open our command line. Create the new files that we will need for our new project. Such as the html file and a file that can hold our js and css if we decide to create those later within the project. Next.
4. Now we have created the html file. We have created a new folder called assets. Within that folder we have created three sub-folders. One folder for the following; css files, images files, and js files. Next.
5. Create our save points and commit these new changes to the file.
6. Copy the template starter code that we are going to use to follow along with the bootstrap-four lesson. Next.
7. After using the code to create our starter template. Use one of the class selectors to test that the bootstrap tools are installed properly within the html file. 
8. Test and run all the code that we have now created within our html file. The bootstrap class selectors work as they should. Next.
