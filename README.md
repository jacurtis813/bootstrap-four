# bootstrap-four
Working with bootstrap four. Continued Self-Taught. Udemy online- Colt Steele.

## Description:
Working with the new library of bootstrap four. Gain the understanding and use (basics) of the bootstrap four library.
Understanding some key differences. Using the new technoques for quick page layout. 
During this build, we will only be building quick web pages to gain the knowledge and the understanding of the bootstrap four library. These sites will not be the best for presentation, serving more of the purpose of demostration. Create a breakdown section to follow along with what we are learning along the way. More than just coding along, understand what we are doing and why we are doing it. Make the note to recall the learning session if needed.

## Breakdown: 

1. Lets begin with creating the README file and filling in all the main content for our purpose behind this project. Next.
2. Create our save points and commit these new changes to the file.
3. Open our command line. Create the new files that we will need for our new project. Such as the html file and a file that can hold our js and css if we decide to create those later within the project. Next.
4. Now we have created the html file. We have created a new folder called assets. Within that folder we have created three sub-folders. One folder for the following; css files, images files, and js files. Next.
5. Create our save points and commit these new changes to the file.
6. Copy the template starter code that we are going to use to follow along with the bootstrap-four lesson. Next.
7. After using the code to create our starter template. Use one of the class selectors to test that the bootstrap tools are installed properly within the html file. 
8. Test and run all the code that we have now created within our html file. The bootstrap class selectors work as they should. Next.
9. Pick back up where we left off, with using the bootstrap four library
10. Apply bootstrap components to understand some of the key differences and to understand why we would like to use the template provided for bootstrap. All the tools that we need to apply the bootstrap content will be accesible with the links that we have within our file.
11. Test and run the code components that we have applied to our file. All working as it should.
12. Walk through the new differences within the bootstrap four docs. Understanding how to search through the bootstrap four docs.
13. Clear all the current content that we have within the html file, bring the file down to the starter template that we began with. Begin using the content from the new section that we are walking through.
14. Use the content from within the utilities section, using the new colors and class names to change the color of the text. Next.
15. Test and run the code content that we have now applied to the html file. All working as should. 
16. Continue the video tutorial walk-through. Clear all the html code that we currently have so that we can test and understand the typography section of bootstrap four.
17. Begin the typography section by using and creating the code for the headings. Next.
18. Continue to style the typography of the page using the new way of usint the blockquote class along with the element name. Next.
19. Test and run all the code and code components that we have built into our html file. All code tested and working well. 
20. Update the readme file. Save all new additions and changes that have been made. Make a commit.
21. Pick up where we left off. Typography section lecture. Working with the blockquote features.
22. Looking over the visual differences with new feature of blockquote using/ calling the class name.
23. Understand and use the new classes to call the properties and values that we would like to use for the blockquote and the citation from who.
24. Copy and use the source code for these two pieces of content. Load to see the visual differences from bootstrap three to bootstrap four.
25. Test and run all the code that we currently have created within our html file to see all visual differences. Save all changes.
26. Further changes. No longer have the use for the blockquote reverse, this would place the quote and the citation to the right. We can simply use the call for text-right which will text-align the content to the right as we would have done with the reverse property.
27. Further chagnes. The font unit has changed from the px units to the Rem units instead. This has now been adopted for the primary css font unit.
28. Continue the video walk through of bootstrap four. Using the borders utilities.
